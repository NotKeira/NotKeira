## Who am I
Hello! I'm Keira, an 18 year old programmer and software enthusiast. I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities.

# Frameworks and Languages
I mainly use TypeScript, C and Rust but I'm experienced in Lua, Python, CPP and C#, Java and so many more!

I have a few projects you can have a look at on my github, but I also have my website available as well as some other websites you can peruse at.
